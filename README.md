  * **May 2022 - A Nerdy Dive into Big Data Tools**
  * Speaker: Alex Antonison
  * In the world of data, there are a wide variety of tools for processing, managing, and analyzing data. When getting started, it can be overwhelming to know what tools are available and what tools to use. In this presentation, Alex Antonison will step through his approach around selecting tools as well as providing a high level overview of the most common data tools he uses in building scalable data applications.

  * **May 2022 - Linux Deep Dive for Data Science**
  * Yingquan Li
  * Data science practitioners who graduate from college or from bootcamps are taught the principles of data science such as statistical modeling techniques, data cleaning best practices, as well unsupervised/supervised machine learning and deep learning algorithms. What is often not emphasized is basic IT/DevOps practices that would enhance any data science practitioner from command line practices, virtual environments, installing Python packages, and more. This talk will go over the basics of command line, Python virtual environments (pyenv), and conda best practices. This will be a scintillating talk for any data science practitioner who wants to increase their IT skills.

  * **Speaker Topic #1 - Data Science & Deep Learning**
  * Speaker: Vishnu Bashyam
  * As a data scientist, working in medicine offers the opportunity to work on interesting and impactful problems. As deep learning has revolutionized computer vision and natural language processing, the use of deep learning-based computer vision techniques has exploded in medical imaging research. Particularly in neuro-imaging, these techniques are expected to enable a new paradigm of precision medicine and patient access. This talk will cover some of the domain knowledge needed to get started in the field, the active areas of research, the common deep learning techniques used, the common pitfalls, and more.

  * **Speaker Topic #2 - Data Science & Canadian Elections**
  * Speaker: Kevin H. Shu
  * The last two Canadian federal elections have resulted in a situation where the party that wins the most seats (and forms government) does not have a plurality of the popular vote. This has renewed calls for change away from the First-Past-The-Post (FPTP) system. This talk aims to examine hypothetical federal results over time if FPTP were changed to two party-list based forms of Proportional Representation at the regional or provincial level.
